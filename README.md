Not your typical dotfiles repo üçì

Welcome to my configuration launch-box!

Every tool, alias, script, configuration, drivers, you name it I use in my Linux machines are described here. Their installation process is described in separate files, promoting isolation and the single responsibility principle. These files are then read by `INSTALL` scripts, which installs them on the host machine. With this, I can create a new machine and get my working environment setup in about ~10 minutes.

Want to go ahead and try my launch-box? üß∞
